# Best Crypto Casino Reddit: Real User Data for 2025

Over the past 3 months, I built a tool to scrape and analyze Reddit for the most recommended **crypto casinos** across major gambling subreddits. My script analyzed over 5000 posts and 47,000 comments, tracking upvotes, positive sentiment, and user experiences to find what the community actually recommends (not just what affiliate marketers push).

The methodology was pretty straightforward: I tracked frequency of positive mentions, filtered out obvious shill posts, and weighted recommendations based on user karma and account age. I also gave more weight to posts with detailed reviews vs. simple "this casino is great" comments. The results were interesting and *sometimes surprising*.
